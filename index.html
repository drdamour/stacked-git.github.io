  <h1>Stacked Git</h1>
  
  <blockquote>
<p>Stacked Git, <strong>StGit</strong> for short, is an application for managing Git
commits as a stack of patches.</p>
<p>With a <em>patch stack</em> workflow, multiple patches can be developed
concurrently and efficiently, with each patch focused on a single
concern, resulting in both a clean Git commit history and improved
productivity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <a href="man/stg"><code>stg</code></a> command line tool provides commands to quickly and
safely manage a stack of patches.</p>
<ul>
<li>Apply and unapplied patches from the stack using
<a href="man/stg-push"><code>push</code></a>, <a href="man/stg-pop"><code>pop</code></a>, and
<a href="man/stg-goto"><code>goto</code></a>.</li>
<li>Incorporate changes from the working tree into a patch and edit patch
metadata using <a href="man/stg-refresh"><code>refresh</code></a> and
<a href="man/stg-edit"><code>edit</code></a>.</li>
<li>Create and delete patches on the stack using <a href="man/stg-new"><code>new</code></a>,
<a href="man/stg-delete"><code>delete</code></a>, and <a href="man/stg-clean"><code>clean</code></a>.</li>
<li>See information about the stack or individual patches using
<a href="man/stg-series"><code>series</code></a> and <a href="man/stg-show"><code>show</code></a>.</li>
<li>Migrate patches to regular commits and <em>vice versa</em> using
<a href="man/stg-commit"><code>commit</code></a> and <a href="man/stg-uncommit"><code>uncommit</code></a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Patch-stack management operations are performed using Git commands and
the patches are stored as Git commit objects, allowing easy merging of
the StGit patches into other repositories using standard Git
functionality.</p>

<h3 id="2022-11-17-stgit-v202v202-has-been-released">2022-11-17: <a href="https://github.com/stacked-git/stgit/releases/tag/v2.0.2">StGit v2.0.2</a> has been released.</h3>
<p>This release further improves support for sparse checkout with partial
clone and worktrees. A few documentation improvements are also included.</p>
<h3 id="2022-11-07-stgit-v201v201-has-been-released">2022-11-07: <a href="https://github.com/stacked-git/stgit/releases/tag/v2.0.1">StGit v2.0.1</a> has been released.</h3>
<p>This bugfix release addresses pathological documentation build
performance issues that should improve the downstream packaging
experience.</p>
<p>See the <a href="changelog/">changelog</a> for all the details on this release.</p>
<h3 id="2022-11-06-stgit-v200v200-has-been-released">2022-11-06: <a href="https://github.com/stacked-git/stgit/releases/tag/v2.0.0">StGit v2.0.0</a> has been released.</h3>
<p>This major release of StGit brings improved performance, several new
features, and many refinements compared to StGit 1.x. It is recommended
that all StGit users upgrade to 2.0.0.</p>
<p>Many thanks to all the StGit users who took the time and effort to try
out the many alpha, beta, and release candidate releases leading up to
this final 2.0.0 release. Lots of issues, big and small, were worked out
from this effort to make this a high-confidence release.</p>
<p>The <a href="changelog/">changelog</a> has the details of the many changes, but
some highlights include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Performance improvements across the board. This is largely due to
StGit 2.0.0 being reimplemented in <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>, thus eliminating
many overheads inherent to the Python interpreter, but also due to
direct accessing the git repository&rsquo;s object database using
<a href="https://libgit2.org/">libgit2</a> instead of always using <code>git</code> subprocesses.</li>
<li>Refined output and improved error messages. Commands generally produce
more terse output. Stack modifying operations (<code>push</code>, <code>pop</code>,
<code>refresh</code>, etc.) use color and sigils to display their outcomes.</li>
<li><code>stg email format</code> and <code>stg email send</code> replace <code>stg mail</code>. The new
commands lean on the battle-hardened <code>git format-patch</code> and <code>git send-email</code> commands, making StGit&rsquo;s email capabilities more robust
and more standard.</li>
<li>StGit aliases now behave like Git aliases.</li>
<li><code>stg refresh</code> gains the <code>-r</code>/<code>--refresh</code> option, which allows a new
patch to be created and record changes with one command.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2022-10-23-stgit-v200-rc2v200-rc2-has-been-released">2022-10-23: <a href="https://github.com/stacked-git/stgit/releases/tag/v2.0.0-rc.1">StGit v2.0.0-rc.2</a> has been released.</h3>
<p>This second 2.0 release candidate repairs several bugs and refines how
git options are passed-through in <code>stg diff</code>, <code>stg show</code>, and <code>stg email</code> commands.</p>
<p>This will likely be the final release candidate before the 2.0.0
release.</p>
<p>See the <a href="changelog/">changelog</a> for all the details on this release.</p>
<h3 id="2022-09-30-stgit-v200-rc1v200-rc1-has-been-released">2022-09-30: <a href="https://github.com/stacked-git/stgit/releases/tag/v2.0.0-rc.1">StGit v2.0.0-rc.1</a> has been released.</h3>
<p>This first 2.0 release candidate brings a new look to the online help thanks to
updating to clap 4.0. Further compatibility improvements with sparse checkouts
and multiple worktrees comes from the update to <code>git2</code> 0.15.0. And several
changes were made to support patch names starting with &lsquo;-&rsquo;.</p>
<p>See the <a href="changelog/">changelog</a> for all the details on this release.</p>
<h3 id="2022-09-02-stgit-extension-for-visual-studio-code-090">2022-09-02: StGit Extension for Visual Studio Code 0.9.0</h3>
<p>How cool is this, Samuel Rydh has implemented a StGit extension for
Visual Studio Code! In Samuel&rsquo;s words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The extension is closely modelled on the corresponding StGit mode for
Emacs, which I have been using for years.</p>
<p>There is a bit of learning curve to use the extension since it is
heavily reliant on operations bound to keyboard shortcuts. The main
audience is really Emacs users that have started to use VSCode.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Several pesky bugs repaired along with some other minor improvements.</p>

<h2 id="why-stacked-git">Why Stacked Git?</h2>
<p>The <em>stack of patches</em> model is a natural way to maintain a clean Git
history while working on several changes concurrently. A stack-oriented
workflow using StGit can compliment, or even replace, many Git workflows
involving rebase, branches, amended commits, and stashes.</p>
<p>StGit, via the <code>stg</code> command line tool, provides commands to quickly and
safely create, push, pop, refresh, and reorder patches.</p>
<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
<h3 id="dependencies">Dependencies</h3>
<p>StGit is written in pure Python with no third-party Python dependencies.
StGit currently supports Python version 3.5 through 3.9. The last
version of StGit to support Python 2 was [v0.23][v0.23].</p>
<p>StGit interoperates closely with Git and does most of its work by
running <code>git</code> commands. Git 2.2.0 or newer is required.</p>
<h3 id="package-repositories">Package Repositories</h3>
<p>Recent versions of StGit are available via many package repositories
such as <a href="https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/stgit">HomeBrew</a> and for many Linux distributions
including: <a href="https://pkgs.alpinelinux.org/packages?name=stgit">Alpine</a>, <a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/stgit">Arch</a>, <a href="https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/stgit">Fedora</a>,
<a href="https://nixos.org/nixos/packages.html?attr=gitAndTools.stgit">Nix</a> and <a href="https://packages.ubuntu.com/source/focal/stgit">Ubuntu</a>.</p>
<p>More details about StGit packages availability for various operating
systems can be <a href="https://repology.org/project/stgit/versions">found on repology</a>.</p>

<h2 id="historical">Historical</h2>
<p>The StGit project was originally hosted at gna.org. That site is no
longer available, but a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170305222727/http://gna.org/projects/stgit/">snapshot</a> remains available via
the <a href="https://web.archive.org/">Wayback Machine</a>.</p>
<h2 id="other-patch-stack-tools">Other Patch Stack Tools</h2>
<p>StGit is not the first or only patch stack tool. Both
<a href="https://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/quilt/">Quilt</a> and Mercurial's <a href="https://www.mercurial-scm.org/wiki/MqExtension">mq extension</a> offer
similar interfaces for managing a stack (or &quot;queue&quot; or &quot;series&quot;) of
patches. While Quilt operates on patches outside the context of any
other version control system using GNU diff, the mq extension is part of
the <a href="https://www.mercurial-scm.org/">Mercurial</a> version control system.</p>
<p>Similar to mq's relationship to Mercurial, StGit is tightly coupled to
Git. StGit keeps its stack metadata as objects in the git repo and
patches themselves are git commits.</p>
