stg-init(1)
===========

NAME
----
stg-init - Initialize a StGit stack on a branch

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'stg init' [OPTIONS]

DESCRIPTION
-----------

Initialize a StGit stack on a branch.

Initializing a branch with a StGit stack commits initial, empty stack state for
the branch to the repository. Theses stack metadata commits are tracked by the
`refs/stacks/<branch>` reference. Updated stack state is committed by each
StGit command that modifies the stack. StGit users do not have to do anything
with the `refs/stacks/<branch>` ref directly.

Some StGit commands, such as `stg new` and `stg uncommit`, will automatically
initialize the stack, so it is often not necessary to explicitly initialize the
stack on a branch. Also, branches created with `stg branch --create` are
automatically initialized.

The branch must already exist and point to a commit before initializing a StGit stack.

StGit stack metadata can be deinitialized from a branch using `stg branch
--cleanup`. See linkstg:branch[] for more details.
