stg-init(1)
===========

NAME
----
stg-init - Initialize a StGit stack on current branch

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'stg init' [OPTIONS]

DESCRIPTION
-----------

Initialize a StGit stack on the current branch.

A branch must be initialized with a StGit stack before patches may be created
with linkstg:new[], imported with linkstg:import[], or picked with linkstg:pick[].

The branch and its git repository must already exist and contain at least one
commit before initializing a StGit stack. Branches created with `stg branch
--create` are automatically initialized.

StGit stack metadata can be deinitialized from a branch using `stg branch
--cleanup`. See linkstg:branch[] for more details.
