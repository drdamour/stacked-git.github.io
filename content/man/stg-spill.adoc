============

NAME
----
stg-spill - Spill changes from the topmost patch

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'stg spill' [OPTIONS] [path]...

DESCRIPTION
-----------

Spill changes from the topmost patch. Changes are removed from the patch, but
remain in the index and worktree.

Spilling a patch may be useful for reselecting the files/hunks to be included
in the patch.

OPTIONS
-------
-a <note>::
--annotate=<note>::
    Annotate the patch log entry with note

-r::
--reset::
    Also reset the index such that the patch's changes only remain in the
    worktree. Without this option, the patch's changes will be in both the
    index and worktree.

--committer-date-is-author-date::
    Instead of using the current time as the committer date, use the author
    date of the commit as the committer date.
