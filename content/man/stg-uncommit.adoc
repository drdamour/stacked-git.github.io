NAME
----
stg-uncommit - Convert regular Git commits into StGit patches

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'stg uncommit' <patchname-1> [<patchname-2> ...]
'stg uncommit' -n number [<patchname-prefix>]
'stg uncommit' -t <committish> [-x]

DESCRIPTION
-----------

Convert one or more Git commits from the base of the current stack into StGit
patches. The original Git commits are not modified; the StGit stack extends to
incorporate these commits as the bottommost applied patches. This is the
opposite of linkstg:commit[].

By default, the number of patches to uncommit is determined by the number of
patch names provided on the command line. The first provided name is used for
the first patch to uncommit, i.e. for the newest patch.

The -n/--number option specifies the number of patches to uncommit. In this
case, at most one patch name may be specified. It is used as prefix to which
the patch number is appended. If no patch names are provided on the command
line, StGit automatically generates names based on the first lines of the
commit messages.

The -t/--to option specifies that all commits up to and including the given
commit should be uncommitted. The -x/--exclusive option may be used to exclude
the "to" commit.

Only commits with exactly one parent can be uncommitted; in other words, merge
commits may not be uncommitted.

OPTIONS

-n <number>::
--number=<number>::
    Uncommit the specified number of commits

-t <committish>::
--to=<committish>::
    Uncommit to the specified committish

-x::
