stg-pull(1)
===========

NAME
----
stg-pull - Pull changes from a remote repository

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'stg pull' [OPTIONS] [repository]

DESCRIPTION
-----------

Pull the latest changes from a remote repository.

The remote repository may be specified on the command line, but defaults to
branch.<name>.remote from the git configuration, or "origin" if not configured.

This command works by popping all currently applied patches from the stack,
pulling the changes from the remote repository, updating the stack base to the
new remote HEAD, and finally pushing all formerly applied patches back onto the
stack. Merge conflicts may occur during the final push step. Those conflicts
need to be resolved manually.

See linkgit:git-fetch[1] for the format of remote repository argument.
        
    

OPTIONS
-------
-n::
--nopush::
    Do not push back patches after pulling

-m::
--merged::
    Check for patches that may have been merged upstream.
+
When pushing-back patches, each patch is checked to see if its changes already
exist in the just-pulled upstream changes. If a patch's changes have already
been merged upstream, the patch will still exist in the stack, but become empty
after the pull operation.
