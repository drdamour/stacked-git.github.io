stg-rebase(1)
=============

NAME
----
stg-rebase - Move the stack base to another point in history

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'stg rebase' [options] [--] [new-base-id]

DESCRIPTION
-----------

Pop all patches from current stack, move the stack base to the given
[new-base-id] and push the patches back.

If you experience merge conflicts, resolve the problem and continue
the rebase by executing the following sequence:

        $ git add --update
        $ stg refresh
        $ stg goto top-patch

Or if you want to skip that patch:

        $ stg undo --hard
        $ stg push next-patch..top-patch

OPTIONS
-------
-i::
--interactive::
        Open an interactive editor to manipulate patches.

-n::
--nopush::
        Do not push the patches back after rebasing.

-m::
--merged::
        Check for patches merged upstream.

--autostash::
        Automatically create a temporary stash before the operation begins, and
        apply it after the operation ends. This means that you can run rebase on a
        dirty work-tree. However, use with care: the final stash application after a
        successful rebase might result in non-trivial conflicts.
