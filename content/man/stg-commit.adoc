stg-commit(1)
=============

NAME
----
stg-commit - Finalize patches to the stack base

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'stg commit' [OPTIONS] [patch]...
'stg commit' [OPTIONS] -n <number>
'stg commit' [OPTIONS] --all

DESCRIPTION
-----------

Finalize one or more patches into the base of the current stack and remove them
from the series. This is the opposite of linkstg:uncommit[]. Use this command
when a patch is completed and no longer needs to be managed with StGit.

By default, the bottommost patch is committed. If patch names are given, the
stack is rearranged so that those patches are at the bottom, and then they are committed.

The -n/--number option specifies the number of applied patches to commit
(counting from the bottom of the stack). If -a/--all is given, all applied
patches are committed.

OPTIONS
-------
-n <number>::
--number=<number>::
    Commit the specified number of applied patches

-a::
--all::
    Commit all applied patches

--allow-empty::
    Allow empty patches to be committed
