===========

NAME
----
stg-sink - Move patches deeper in the stack

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'stg sink' [OPTIONS] [patch]...

DESCRIPTION
-----------

Move the specified patches down the stack.

If no patch is specified on the command line, the current (topmost) patch is
sunk. By default, patches are sunk to the bottom of the stack, but the
'--above' or '--below' (alias '--to') options may be used to place them above
or below any applied patch.

Internally, sinking involves popping all patches to the bottom (or to the
target patch if '--above' or '--below' is used), then pushing the patches to
sink, and then, unless '--nopush' is specified, pushing back any other formerly
applied patches.

Sinking may be useful, for example, to group stable patches at the bottom of
the stack where they less likely to be impacted by the push of another patch,
and from where they can be more easily committed or pushed to another repository.


OPTIONS
-------
-n::
--nopush::
    Do not push any formerly applied patches after sinking. Only the patches to
    sink are pushed.

-t <target>::
--below=<target>::
--to=<target>::
    Sink patches below <target> patch.
+
Specified patches are placed below <target> instead of at the bottom of the stack.

-T <target>::
--above=<target>::
    Sink patches above <target> patch.
+
Specified patches are placed above <target> instead of at the bottom of the stack.

-k::
--keep::
    Keep the local changes

--committer-date-is-author-date::
    Instead of using the current time as the committer date, use the author
    date of the commit as the committer date.
