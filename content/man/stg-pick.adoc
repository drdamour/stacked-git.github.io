===========

NAME
----
stg-pick - Import a patch from a different branch or a commit object

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'stg pick' [options] [--] ([<patch1>] [<patch2>] [<patch3>..<patch4>])|<commit>

DESCRIPTION
-----------

Import one or more patches from a different branch or a commit object
into the current series. By default, the name of the imported patch is
used as the name of the current patch. It can be overridden with the
'--name' option. A commit object can be reverted with the '--revert'
option. The log and author information are those of the commit
object.

When using the '--expose' option, the format of the commit message is
determined by the 'stgit.pick.expose-format' configuration option. This option
is a format string as may supplied as the '--pretty' option to
linkgit:git-show[1]. The default is "format:%B%n(imported from commit %H)",
which appends the commit hash of the picked commit to the patch's commit
message.
